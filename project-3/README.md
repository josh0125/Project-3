Application Explanation:

For my projct I created a React application that would be used by recruiters from companies that need to review resumes during the hiring process. As I have talked to recruiters, many are opposed to having AI review their candidates and would rather give everyone a chance by looking at each resume.

Therefore, this application will hopefully help speed up that process. The evaluator will highlight certain key words that the recruiter in looking for in the resume. A few standard ones like GPA and SAT are able to be toggled, so those words can be highlighted on the resume. Recruiters also have the ability to add their own checks they can look for. For the MVP, the highlight will only work for those specific words, but in the future we would hope to use OpenAI to better interrupt the resumes.

As recruiters look through the application, they can either reject or accept the resume based on their criteria. In the future, they would have the ability to email applicants either an accepted email or rejected one.

The application also currently is taking a waitlist of those interested.

Key Takeaways:
As I went through this project, I learned a lot about how React works. I have done mini React projects before, but this was a lot bigger of a project. I was able to create a structure for all my differents pages, sections, and components. By breaking these up, the application was able a lot more clear and the components were able to preform their functions and have their own styling.

I was also able to learn the importance of useState and useEffect throughout the application. By having the state variables, I was able to adjust different part of the applications depending on what the user did. Useeffect was also new for me, but it was very important when pulling the data from the "backend".

Last of all, I was able to learn about some new packages like react-pdf and json-server. Both of these were very helpful throughout the project. Json-server was a simple solution I could use to serve up the data I was using in the project. React-pdf was a bit more confusing, and I would likely not use this in the future, but for an MVP it did the job.

Overall, I enjoyed this project a lot even though the styling was a hassle. I will continue to use react in the future because of this project!
